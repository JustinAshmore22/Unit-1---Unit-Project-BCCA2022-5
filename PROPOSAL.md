# PROPOSAL: Unit Project 
## (Richard Tutor and Justin Ashmore)

### Description:
"The SCP([Special Containment Procedures] or [Secure Contain Protect]) Foundation is a fictional organization documented by the web-based collaborative-fiction project of the same name. Within the website's fictional setting, the SCP Foundation is responsible for locating and containing individuals, entities, locations, and objects that violate natural law."

This program is based off the SCP Foundation where you can explore and decide your actions. In this program you will be able to explore and find individuals/items that the SCP Foundation has captured. The user will have to be able to input correct actions in time in order to survive.

### Prior Art: 
We will implement knowledge gained from other projects such as Module 4 "Explorer" project and Module 3 "Turn-Based Health Depleter" project.  Both projects heavily influenced this decision to make this game.

### Core User Workflow: 
The User should be able to explore one SCP Foundation building.  There will be time limited inputs and correct/incorrect action choices, hidden areas, and special items to make certain things easier.

### Tuesday-Thursday Daily Goals:
- [ ] Tuesday: 

        Plan Items, SPCs, and Areas.
        
        Gain descriptions for Items, areas, and SCPs.
        
        Justin: Set variable descriptions (like Item descriptions, what SCPs are capable of and how they act, adn what certain areas look like)
        
        Richard: Definine functions (such as validation input, correct area transfers, invalid location input and timed input) 
- [ ] Wednesday:
        
        Richard: Finalize core functions (Area transfers and timed input)

        Justin: Finalize main descriptions (Areas, SCPs, Items, and Background.) - Join Richard in finalizing core functions.

        Both: Run over description and see if written code works properly.
- [ ] Thursday:

        Finalize descriptions of items, areas and SPCs. Make sure code runs correctly, follows rubric and style guide. Also, get prepared for presentation of the program.

### Utilization of Unit Content:
While loops will be used for input validation, use of functions for printing information on arrival of a location and transfer to a destination, Variables used to set descriptions, and Dataclasses to define a user's items and status.
