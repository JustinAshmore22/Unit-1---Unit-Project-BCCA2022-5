# SCP FOUNDATION: UNIT 1 Project 
    - By Justin Ashmore and Richard Tutor
### Why we chose it:
- We chose to do our project on the SCP Foundation because of the amount of creative freedom it allows with the data it provides.  Though most of the data on their website is dark, the stories/content that can be made with it is nearly endless.

## Description: 
- A hardcore play-through based off the SCP(Secure Contain Protect) Foundation, you can travel to 7 different levels with level 0 being the beginning and 6 being the end level. Each floor is different and has a different SCP starting with level 1. There is item use, changing levels, enemy attacks, and traps. 

####  SCPs Used:
- The Vending Machine(SCP-261)    
- The Staircase(SCP-087)
- Billy(SCP-173): 
- Bobble the Clown(SCP-993)
- (SCP-096)
- Orange-Slime(SCP-999):
